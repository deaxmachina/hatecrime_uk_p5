            Each of the circular shapes corresponds to 100 hate crime incidents reported to the police 
            (London Met Police, London, UK). The definition of “Racist and Religious Hate Crime” 
            in the UK includes non-criminal incidents triggered by the race, ethnicity, or religion 
            of the victim. 
            I chose this topic because of my experience of escalating  
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/eu-27-migration-a-new-chapter" target="_blank" class="link">anti-Eastern European sentiments and verbal abuse</a>
            since the early 2010s, and because I know that my own experience unfortunately doesn’t even scratch the surface of the problem.

            The flowing veil surrounding the dark unhappy shapes is my representation of the 
            sometimes invisible ‘shield’ of love, support, friendship. I wanted to find a way 
            to elevate the acts of kindness that happen in the community all the time. 
            Unfortunately, while media accounts of negative sentiments abound, the positive 
            stories rarely get noticed.

          I started learning p5.js only a couple of months ago, and I couldn’t have done 
          this without the 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw " target="_blank" class="link">amazing video tutorials</a> of 
          the Coding Train (Dan Shiffman). I look forward to continuing my learning and more creative coding projects in p5.
