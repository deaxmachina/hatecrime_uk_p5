            Each of the circular shapes corresponds to 100 hate crime incidents reported to the police 
            (London Met Police, London, UK). The definition of “Racist and Religious Hate Crime” 
            in the UK includes non-criminal incidents triggered by the race, ethnicity, or religion 
            of the victim. 
            I chose this topic because I immigrated from Bulgaria around a time of escalating 
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/eu-27-migration-a-new-chapter" target="_blank" class="link">anti-Eastern European sentiments</a>
             (“benefit seekers”, “stealing our jobs”, “low skilled”, 
            “poor countries”, “go home”...)
            I know that my own experience unfortunately doesn’t even scratch the surface of 
            the problem. And that shapes on a screen are not enough to make any difference. 
            We see that hate crime is on the rise, but what do we do about it?

            The flowing veil surrounding the dark unhappy shapes is my representation of the 
            sometimes invisible ‘shield’ of love, support, friendship. I wanted to find a way 
            to elevate the acts of kindness that happen in the community all the time. 
            Unfortunately, while media accounts of negative sentiments abound, the positive 
            stories rarely get noticed.

            Notes: I struggled to find data with consistent number of reported hate crime incidents over the years. 
            I referenced multiple official sources. More detailed notes and data preparation code 
            can be found in my Jupyter notebook here, or in-browser here.

          I started learning p5.js only a couple of months ago, and I couldn’t have done 
          this without the
